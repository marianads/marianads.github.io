---

I am a PhD-level engineer and scientist with over 5 years of experience in materials and mechanical engineering, 
I thrive in multicultural and project-oriented workplaces. My expertise lies in experimental polymer tribology, and 
my passion for innovation drives me to turn scientific knowledge into practical solutions that add value, support 
industrial products, and have a positive impact on society and the environment.
