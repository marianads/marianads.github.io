I have experience in the area of Materials Engineering and Metallurgy with emphasis on ceramic materials, characterization, and mechanical treatments of surfaces. I am currently working at the [Laboratoire de Tribologie et Dynamique des Systèmes](http://ltds.ec-lyon.fr/spip/?lang=fr). (LTDS - UMR 5513), École Centrale de Lyon doing research in Experimental Contact Mechanics.
