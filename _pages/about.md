I am a Materials Engineer from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (2015) with a sandwich period at École Nationale d’Ingénieurs de Saint-Etienne (2013). 
I have experience in the area of Materials Engineering and Metallurgy with emphasis on ceramic materials, characterization, and mechanical treatments of surfaces. 
Currently, I am working at the [Laboratoire de Tribologie et Dynamique des Systèmes}(http://ltds.ec-lyon.fr/spip/?lang=fr) (LTDS - UMR 5513) at École Centrale de Lyon doing research in Experimental Contact Mechanics of Soft Matter.
